\usage{
dosresmeta.control(optim = list(), showiter = FALSE, maxiter = 100,
  initPsi = NULL, Psifix = NULL, Scor = NULL, addSlist = NULL,
  inputna = FALSE, inputvar = 10^4, loglik.iter = "hybrid",
  igls.inititer = 10, gr = FALSE, hessian = FALSE, vc.adj = TRUE,
  reltol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), checkPD = NULL,
  set.negeigen = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
}
\arguments{
\item{optim}{list of parameters passed to the control argument of the function optim, which performs the quasi-Newton optimization in likelihood-based 
random-effects models. See \code{\link{optim}}.}

\item{showiter}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the progress of iterative optimization is shown.}

\item{maxiter}{positive interger value. Maximum number of iterations in methods involving optimization procedures.}

\item{initPsi}{either a matrix or a vector of its lower triangular elements (with diagonal, taken by column) from which starting 
values of the parameters of the between-study (co)variance matrix are derived, used in the optimization procedure for likelihood-based random-effects models. 
If \code{NULL} (the default, and recommended), the starting value is created internally through an iterative generalized least square algorithm.}

\item{Psifix}{either a matrix or a vector of its lower triangular elements (with diagonal, taken by column), or optionally a named list with one or more of such objects. 
Used to define fixed parts of the random-effects}

\item{Scor}{either a scalar, vector or matrix representing the within-unit correlation(s) to be inputted when the covariances are not provided 
in multivariate models, and ignored if they are.}

\item{addSlist}{a list of m matrices for the (outer-level) groups of units defining the (known) error (co)variance structure, 
when this cannot be passed through the argument S of mixmeta.}

\item{inputna}{logical. If missing values must be internally inputted. To be used with caution.}

\item{inputvar}{multiplier for inputting the missing variances, to be passed as an argument to inputna.}

\item{loglik.iter}{iterative scheme used in in likelihood-based optimization routines. Options are "hybrid", "newton", and "igls" or "RIGLS".}

\item{igls.inititer}{number of iteration of the iterative generalized least square algorithm to be run in the hybrid optimization procedure 
of linkelihood-based models to provide the starting value.}

\item{gr}{indicates if the gradient of the (re)ml likelihood should be provided. FALSE by default.}

\item{hessian}{logical. If TRUE, the Hessian matrix of the parameters estimated in the optimization process is computed and returned. Only applicable to likelihood-based estimation methods.}

\item{vc.adj}{logical. If TRUE, an adjustement to the way the marginal variance part is computed in the (co)variance components estimator is applied in the variance components estimator.}

\item{reltol}{relative convergence tolerance in methods involving optimization procedures. The algorithm stops if it is unable to 
reduce the value by a factor of \eqn{reltol * (abs(val) + reltol)} at a step.}

\item{checkPD}{logical. Determines if the semi-positiveness of within-unit error or random-effects (co)variance matrices must be checked.}

\item{set.negeigen}{positive value. Value to which negative eigenvalues are to be set in estimators where such method is used to force semi-positive 
definiteness of the estimated between-study (co)variance matrix.}

\value{
A list with components named as the arguments.

\description{
This internal function sets the parameter options used for fitting dose-response meta-analytical models, 
commonly to pre-specified default values. It is usually internally called by \code{\link{dosresmeta.fit}}.
The function has many more arguments than needed for dosresmeta. For more details see \code{\link{mixmeta.control}}.
}
\examples{
## Loading data
data("alcohol_cvd")

## print the iterations (see ?optim) and change the default for starting values
dosresmeta(formula = logrr ~ dose, type = type, id = id, se = se, 
           cases = cases, n = n, data = alcohol_cvd, proc = "1stage",
           control = list(showiter = TRUE, igls.inititer = 20))
