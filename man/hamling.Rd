\title{Approximating effective-counts as proposed by Hamling}
\usage{
hamling(y, v, cases, n, type, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector, defining the (reported) log relative risks.}

\item{v}{a vector, defining the variances of the reported log relative risks.}

\item{cases}{a vector, defining the number of cases for each exposure level.}

\item{n}{a vector, defining the total number of subjects for each exposure level. For incidence-rate data \code{n} indicates the amount of person-time within
each exposure level.}

\item{type}{a vector (or a character string), specifying the design of the study. Options are
\code{cc}, \code{ir}, and \code{ci}, for case-control, incidence-rate, and cumulative incidence data, respectively.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the variables in the previous arguments.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following
\tabular{ll}{
\code{y} \tab mean or standardized mean differences for each treatment level,
included the referent one (0 by calculation).\cr
\code{v} \tab variances corresponding to the mean or standardized mean differences for each
treatment level, included the referent one (0 by calculation)\cr
\code{S} \tab co(variance) matrix for the non-referent mean or standardized mean differences.\cr
}
}
\description{
Reconstructs the set of pseudo-numbers (or "effective" numbers) of cases and non-cases consistent
with the input data (log relative risks). The method was first proposed in 2008 by Hamling.
}
\details{
The function reconstructs the effective counts corresponding to the multivariable adjusted log relative risks as well as their standard errors.
A unique solution is guaranteed by keeping the ratio non-cases to cases and the fraction of unexposed subjects equal to the unadjusted data (Hamling).
See the referenced article for a complete description of the algorithm implementation.

\examples{
## Loading data
data("alcohol_cvd")

## Obtaining pseudo-counts for the first study (id = 1)
hamling(y = logrr, v = I(se^2), cases = cases, n = n, type = type,
data = subset(alcohol_cvd, id == 1))

## Obtaining pseudo-counts for all study
by(alcohol_cvd, alcohol_cvd$id, function(x)
hamling(y = logrr, v = I(se^2), cases = cases, n = n, type = type, data = x))

## Restructuring the previous results in a matrix
do.call("rbind", by(alcohol_cvd, alcohol_cvd$id, function(x)
   hamling(y = logrr, v = I(se^2), cases = cases, n = n, type = type,
      data = x)))
